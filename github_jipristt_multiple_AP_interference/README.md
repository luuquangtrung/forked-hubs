# WiFi-Project
Wireless networking project on NS3 simualtor 

This project aims to simulate situation where there are multiple APs interfering with each other. This situation could be for example a block of flats where multiple WiFi routers (neighbors) cover the available channels and interfere with each other. 

The goal of this project is to observe what are actually the gains of choosing a "good" WiFi channel for an apartment compared to using a very "busy" channel.
